# Overview of Logistics

## Time

OceanHackWeek 2020 will take place **online** daily, during the period 11am-2pm PDT / 2pm-5pm EDT / 18:00-21:00 UTC on August 10-14. Tutorials will cover data science topics, followed by project hacking in the afternoon. [Pre-hackweek OPTIONAL activities](../schedule.md#pre-hackweek-optional-tutorials) will be on August 6-7. See [Tutorial schedule](../schedule.md#tutorials) for details.

## Channel of communication: Slack

We will use the [OceanHackWeek Slack workspace](http://oceanhackweek.slack.com/) as the main channel of communication before, during, and after the hackweek. You should have received an invitation to join this workspace. If you haven't seen it in your inbox, check your spam folder, or email us at *oceanhkw@uw.edu*.

In the OHW Slack workspace, you have the ability to [go directly from a channel or direct message chat into a voice or video chat](https://slack.com/help/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack), with screen-sharing capability. This will be particularly useful during hack project time.

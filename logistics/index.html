- Ask all your questions on Slido in the #tutorials channel.
- Vote up questions on Slido in the #tutorials channel so that moderator can prioritize them during the question time.

## Flights and ground transportation

For your flights, the closest airport to our university is the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, which offers a range of connections to the University of Washington Campus.

[The Link light rail](https://www.soundtransit.org/schedules/route/40_100479) is an easy, great way to get to the UW from the airport. It arrives at the airport every 5-15 minutes, and the ride to the UW campus is about 45 minutes. The UW station is just a 15-minute walk from Alder Hall.

From the arrivals hall at Sea-Tac Airport, follow the signs for Link Light Rail; the station is a short walk from the terminal on the far side of the parking garage. Tickets must be purchased at the station before boarding. The cost is $3.25 and can be paid in cash or with a credit/debit card. Take the train to the last stop (UW). Here are [directions](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Lander+Hall,+Northeast+Campus+Parkway,+Seattle,+WA/u+district+transit+station/@47.6528664,-122.311707,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x549014f3ba07b78b:0xccf338a83d26e753!2m2!1d-122.3152398!2d47.655878!1m5!1m1!1s0x549014eca005d559:0x2a5b4b6f98dddc9c!2m2!1d-122.3037968!2d47.6498399!3e2walking) from the UW link stop to the Lander Hall where many of you will check in to stay at Alder Hall.

Taxi’s and uber/lyft are also available from the airport. Please note that for uber/lyft, you will need to meet the car on the 3rd floor parking lot for pick up.

Each funded participant will receive up to $400 if they are a domestic participant or $800 if they are an international participant. The grants are for covering flights and commuting expenses only. Please note that business or first class airfare cannot be reimbursed for any reason. All flights must adhere to outlined guidelines as for federal funds [see “Travel” in article 10](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/gc1/jan17.pdf) and the [Fly America Act](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/travel-management-policy/fly-america-act). Expenses of Individual flights must be itemized on documented receipts, along with commuting expenses such as bus tickets, shuttle receipts, etc. Please be especially aware of this when using travel expense aggregating websites such as expedia.com, as not all of these sorts of websites clearly itemize individual travel expenses. International travelers must additionally provide traveler’s I-94 form which are completed upon entry into the US.
If you have any questions about travel policies, please email travel@uw.edu

After making sure that all the above requirements are met, please go ahead and book your flights and hold onto all documentation for claiming your reimbursement after the event. All funded travelers will be put in contact with the travel coordinator to send their documentation to via email after the event has concluded.


## Lodging

All funded participants will be staying in a doubles dorm at Alder Hall. They will be assigned at random to another participant of the same sex. You must email oceanhkw@uw.edu by July 19 if you have any special needs.

Non-funded participants have the option of being randomly paired with another participant of the same sex in a double dorm for $56.50 per night at Alder Hall. They can also stay in a single dorm at Alder Hall for $96 per night. If you prefer either of these options, you must let us know by emailing oceanhkw@uw.edu by July 19 to be added to the list.

Other affordable options can be found in the [UW guest housing program](https://washington.irisregistration.com/Register?code=GuestHousing19).

UW has some [homestay programs](https://www.ielp.uw.edu/housing/homestays/) which may be worth looking into. However, there may be some additional commuting you will have to do depending on where your homestay location is if you decide to go with this option.

If you prefer to stay at a hotel, here are some in walking distance from our hackweek venue that we recommend:
